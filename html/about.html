<div class="p2">How Do You Program?</div>

<div class="p2">Why Do You Program?</div>
<p class="caption">Programming is a delicate art and very under appreciated. I thoroughly enjoy it, writing what looks like meaningless lines to most people which actually mean a lot to everyone. Programming is a skilled art, more so than many other arts out there.</p>
<div class="p2">What Do You Program?</div>
<p class="caption">Currently, I only work in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python3. However, I have worked in Python2.7 and Java. I don't plan on returning to Java or Python2.7 since they're depreciated. And I also never plan on working in Swift, Objective-C, dot.NET, C# or JScript <em>nice tangent</em></p>
