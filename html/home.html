<div class="p2"><strong>No Flash</strong><img src="images/flash.png" class="icon"></img></div>
<p class="caption">We don't use Adobe Flash or Microsoft Silverlight, meaning all our websites have full compatibility with modern browsers. They can be accessed and used on any device running any operating system with no limitations</p>
<div class="p2"><strong>Different Devices</strong><img src="images/browser.png" class="icon"></img></div>
<p class="caption">2 stylesheets, hundreds of devices. By using 2 sets of configurations for all the webpage elements, it means one can seamlessly load a mobile version at the touch of a button, making our websites compatible with any device (if you find a device that the site does not work on, please contact me)</p>
<div class="p2"><strong>GitHub Storage</strong><img src="images/github.png" class="icon"></img></div>
<p class="caption">GitHub is one of our tools we use to develop websites. It means you can see your website's development as we make it. Every version is at your disposal and if you're not happy with the website as the latest version, you can comment and we'll be able to fix it quicker before it gets built in.</p>
